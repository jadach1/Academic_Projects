<h2 class="one">San Pedro Sula, Honduras</h2>
<aside class="one">
<img src="../Media/F1.jpg" alt="City" height="100" width="100">
<q>
This city has ranked as one of the worlds 
most violent for several years now. According to 
many sources, it has the highest homicide rates in the 
world -169 per 100,000 people. Arms trafficking is a big problem, 
and illegal firearms are prevalent throughout the city. 
This is a city that tourists would do well to avoid.

<h2 class="two">The Best Low-Cost Airlines, Based on Awards and Reviews</h2>
<h2 class="two">AirAisa</h2>
<aside class="two">
<img src="../Media/F2.jpg" alt="Airline" height="100" width="100">
<q>
This year, the airline was named the Worlds Best Low-Cost Carrier 
for the third consecutive year at the World Airline Awards, which is 
voted on by 18.8 million airline passengers worldwide. In addition, it 
was voted as a finalist in About.coms survey of Best International Budget 
Airlines (survey participants based their evaluation on airfare, efficiency, 
convenience, service, fee structure and availability). Based in Malaysia, it 
is the largest low-fare, no-frills airline in the Far East and it offers flights 
to more than 400 destinations in 25 countries. It’s been a pioneer in Asia helping 
3 billion people stay better connected to the rest of the world – as illustrated by its slogan: 
“Now Everyone Can Fly.”Recent passenger review: “As good as it gets as far as low-cost 
carriers go, no check-in or baggage problems, allocated seats, on-time departures and arrivals, clean, 
modern A320’s and efficient and friendly cabin crews. Granted, not much leg room, but more than on some 
European operators, including a couple of full service airlines I can think of."<span style="color: red">Courtesy of: </span><a href="http://www.farecompare.com/travel-advice/the-5-best-low-cost-airlines/#/">farecompare</a>

 <h2 class="one">Best Travel Food:  Granola Bars</h2>
 <aside class="one">
<img src="../Media/F5.jpg" alt="food" height="100" width="100">
 <q> I am a self-professed granola bar fiend. Maybe it's an ingrained snacking habit 
 from the countless bars eaten in the back seat of the car before ballet practice all through grade s
 chool. Or maybe it's the fact that I tend to get hangry if I go too long between meals. Either way, I ne
 arly always have a granola bar or two close at hand. Making my own from the assortment of oats, nuts, and dr
 ied fruits that are always in my cupboard was a natural next step.</q> <span style="color: red">Courtesy of: </span><a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-homemade-granola-bars-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-176676">The Kitchen</a>
