<td> The Taj Mahal is located on the right bank of the Yamuna River in a vast Mughal garden that encompasses nearly 17 hectares, 
in the Agra District in Uttar Pradesh. It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal with construction 
starting in 1632 AD and completed in 1648 AD, with the mosque, the guest house and the main gateway on the south, the outer courtyard 
and its cloisters were added subsequently and completed in 1653 AD. The existence of several historical and Quaranic inscriptions in 
Arabic script have facilitated setting the chronology of Taj Mahal. For its construction, masons, stone-cutters, inlayers, carvers, painters, 
calligraphers, dome builders and other artisans were requisitioned from the whole of the empire and also from the Central Asia and Iran. 
Ustad-Ahmad Lahori was the main architect of the Taj Mahal.<br> Courtery of: http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/252</td>

<td><img class="se" src="../Media/T2.jpg" alt="Col"></td>
<td> Located just east of the Roman Forum, the massive stone amphitheater known as the Colosseum was commissioned around A.D. 70-72 by 
Emperor Vespasian of the Flavian dynasty as a gift to the Roman people. In A.D. 80, Vespasian’s son Titus opened the Colosseum–officially 
known as the Flavian Amphitheater–with 100 days of games, including gladiatorial combats and wild animal fights. After four centuries of 
active use, the magnificent arena fell into neglect, and up until the 18th century it was used as a source of building materials. 
Though two-thirds of the original Colosseum has been destroyed over time, the amphitheater remains a popular tourist destination, 
as well as an iconic symbol of Rome and its long, tumultuous history.<br> Courtesy of: http://www.history.com/topics/ancient-history/colosseum</td>

<th colspan="2">The Angkor Wat</th>

<tr>
<td><img class="se" src="../Media/T3.jpg" alt="Ang"></td>
<td> Angkor, in Cambodia’s northern province of Siem Reap, is one of the most important archaeological sites of Southeast Asia. It extends 
over approximately 400 square kilometres and consists of scores of temples, hydraulic structures (basins, dykes, reservoirs, canals) as 
well as communication routes. For several centuries Angkor, was the centre of the Khmer Kingdom. With impressive monuments, several different 
ancient urban plans and large water reservoirs, the site is a unique concentration of features testifying to an exceptional civilization. 
Temples such as Angkor Wat, the Bayon, Preah Khan and Ta Prohm, exemplars of Khmer architecture, are closely linked to their geographical 
context as well as being imbued with symbolic significance. The architecture and layout of the successive capitals bear witness to a high level 
of social order and ranking within the Khmer Empire. Angkor is therefore a major site exemplifying cultural, religious and symbolic values, as 
well as containing high architectural, archaeological and artistic significance..

<th colspan="2">St. Peter's Basilica</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img class="se" src="../Media/T4.jpg" alt="St.P"></td>
<td> To understand the origins of the Basilica, we need to go back in time almost 2,000 years. It wasn’t by chance that it was built here; this 
was the place where the apostle was killed and then buried. Peter, given this name by Jesus because he would be the “pietra”, the rock, on which 
the Church would be built, was the most dynamic of the Apostles: he was put in jail and then miraculously liberated, he left Jerusalem for Rome, 
center of the Roman Empire. Here he was first bishop then pope for 25 years.

<th colspan="2">machu picchu</th>

<tr>
<td><img class="se" src="../Media/T5.jpg" alt="Mach"></td>
<td> The ruins of Machu Picchu, rediscovered in 1911 by Yale archaeologist Hiram Bingham, are one of the most beautiful and enigmatic ancient 
sites in the world. While the Inca people certainly used the Andean mountain top (7972 feet elevation), erecting many hundreds of stone structures 
from the early 1400's, legends and myths indicate that Machu Picchu (meaning 'Old Peak' in the Quechua language) was revered as a sacred place from a 
far earlier time. Whatever its origins, the Inca turned the site into a small (5 square miles) but extraordinary city.
